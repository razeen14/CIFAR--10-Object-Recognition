# CIFAR--10-Object-Recognition
The CIFAR-10 Object Recognition project uses the ResNet50 model to classify images into 10 categories (airplanes, cars, cats, etc.) from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 50,000 32x32 images. Key steps include data preprocessing (normalization), model training, and evaluation using libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
